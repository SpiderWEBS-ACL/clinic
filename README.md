# Clinic Online Web App Portal

This project is full stack running web app for medical purposes, we have 2 main portals, Clinic and Pharmacy portals.

In this repo the clinic portal is focused on relations between a patient user and doctor user, where a patient can do most of the actions they could normally do in an actual in real life clinic.

Doctors get to interact with their patients and update their own info according to their work style.
